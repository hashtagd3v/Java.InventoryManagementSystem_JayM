Java Inventory Management System: Performance Assessment for WGU SOFTWARE I - OBJECT ORIENTED APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT — C482

This is a mock inventory management system that lets you add, modify and delete parts and products written in Java. Utilized Scene Builder (JAVA FXML for GUI).

SCENARIO:
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to
manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and development of the system and a class diagram to assist
you in your work. The organization also has specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. A system
analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the requirements section based on the manufacturing organization’s business requirements. You will use
these solution statements to develop your application.
